## 1.3 Typeface Classification

**Some Notes:**

1. I lumped in Old Style and Humanist classifications together, but they can be separated into its own category. (check out I Love Typography blog articles on [Humanist](https://ilovetypography.com/2007/11/06/type-terminology-humanist-2/) and [Old Style](https://ilovetypography.com/2007/11/21/type-terminology-old-style/).
 
2. The Times New Roman typeface is shown as an example of 'Old Style', but technically speaking it is somewhere in the middle of Old Style and Transitional. (check out [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Roman) for more info). That being said, it has a noticeable angled stress that I consider to be the easiest way for beginners to spot an old style typeface, so i chose to put it in the old style category.
